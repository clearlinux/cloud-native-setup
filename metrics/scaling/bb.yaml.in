# We use a deployment rather than a pod directly specifically so we can use it to
# generate more replicas by re-deploying it.
# The only downside might be, if containers go wrong or die etc., then the deployment
# is going to try and re-deploy them, and we may not notice or get stuck waiting for
# them, so we want to be careful in the test code to time out in such cases.
